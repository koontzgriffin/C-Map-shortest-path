# C-Map-shortest-path
This program creates a map by reading from files containing locations and roads around the US. These files are read into road and node objects containing the useful information. A map object contains a vector storing all nodes and has needed methods. The program starts by prompting the user to enter a number corresponding to a starting node  then another for and ending node. Once entered, the program uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path between to nodes.
